		<h1>Players</h1>
		<h2 id="zgeorgin">Zgeorgin</h2>
		<p class = "container"> Team captain. Many tournament players know that when playing against him, you need to have a strong defense, because he likes to play aggressively in the middle stage of the game and strike with several groups of troops. This does not save everyone, because he competently adapts to each player and identifies their weaknesses.</p>
		<h2 id="immortal">1mm0rtal</h2>
		<p class = "container"> A player who knows how to surprise any opponent. He likes fast, aggressive and interesting strategies, but he can just as well win in a protracted game. Opponents are always preparing for his style, but 1mm0rtal always has his ace up his sleeve. At the SAC #01 Platinum Division tournament, several finalists admitted in interviews that the most interesting games were against him.

		<h2 id="raider">Raider</h2>
		<p class = "container"> The main secret of the team. He constantly comes up with strategies that differ in the style of the game, so it is impossible to prepare for him. He can win quickly due to unexpected early aggression, or he can starve the enemy, keeping him on his bases and delivering small blows. Some players are afraid to play against him, because playing with him is mentally exhausting due to the fact that it is impossible to predict his moves in advance. At his first tournament, he not only earned such a reputation and the recognition of commentators (see the video below), but also received a cash prize.
