		<h3> A bit of history </h3>
		<p class=container>
		StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is a real-time strategy computer game and a sequel to StarCraft. It was announced on May 19, 2007, at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational in Seoul, South Korea. Unlike the previous game in the series, StarCraft II features 3D graphics and uses the Havok physics engine. Originally intended to be a single game, it was announced at BlizzCon 2008 that StarCraft II would be a trilogy, with the first part titled StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty and two expansions named Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty was released on July 27, 2010.
