	<h2>Achievements</h2>
	<p>1. At the SAC #01 Platinum Division tournament, <FLarva>Raider took the third place, never losing (there were only draws), and received a prize of $4. The last Raider game at the tournament was very spectacular and was remembered by commentators as one of the best. 1mm0rtal also participated in the same tournament and took 4th place.</p>

	<p>2. 1mm0rtal took 5th place in the Platinum Heroes V tournament. He was very close to getting into the semi-finals and thus to the podium, but in a tense fight he could not defeat Niven with a score of 2:1. Despite this, 1mm0rtal is a great fellow, and we congratulate him on this result.
